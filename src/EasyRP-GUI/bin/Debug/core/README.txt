# EasyRP (Custom Discord Rich Presence)


EasyRP is a small program to use the DiscordRPC library without any knowledge of programming.

Instead just use an easy conifg file



**Usage**

- First you need to register a Rich Presence application with discord
     
	- Go here https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
     
	- Make a new application **The name of the app will be the main name for the rich presence**

	- Enable rich presence for your app and add some assets
- Edit the config file with the information from your newly registered app

- Run EasyRP.exe (it should open a cmd window)
    
	- It should report errors from your config file (if there are any)

- Go into discord settings and add the EasyRP.exe as a game

- Discord should automatically change the path of EasyRP.exe to your Discord Rich Presence


- You can edit the config any time while the program is running to change the presence
